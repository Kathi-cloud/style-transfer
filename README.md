# Style Transfer

Welcom to machine learning.

This repository contain learning material for style transfer algorithms.
You can use it for generating images, and then di the code if you are curious.

# Credits
This code is inspired from the pytorch tutorial, and through the tensorflow implementation
of [Greg surma](https://towardsdatascience.com/style-transfer-styling-images-with-convolutional-neural-networks-7d215b58f461).
