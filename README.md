You can use it for generating images, and then di the code if you are curious.

# Credits
This code is inspired from the [pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html),
and the tensorflow implementation of [Greg surma](https://github.com/gsurma/style_transfer).
